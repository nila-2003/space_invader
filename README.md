# space_invader
I made this game with Python's pygame package. 
This module, in my opinion, provides some of the simplest techniques to create games. This module is suitable for beginners. 
The game has a spaceship that can travel around in a straight line using the left and right arrow buttons.
The main objective is to eliminate the aliens before they reach the spaceship. For this shot, the space bar is used.
The game's technology is such that it can shoot only after the preceding bullet has vanished from the screen. 
The method is simple to comprehend and implement.
